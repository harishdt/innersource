# Welcome!

This repository will be a working website that you can publish as your own InnerSource landing page.

As we work, we'll create a resource that others can use within your organization. This repository will be useful even after you finish this course.

This is how this course will move along:

- Every new issue or pull request will start with a challenge question
- You'll answer the challenge question _(don't worry, there are no right or wrong answers!)_
- The question will highlight the importance of each topic in InnerSource practices

Here's your first challenge question!
