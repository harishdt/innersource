### Answer :crystal_ball:

The real answer is that, without documentation, we don't know!

This pull request covers the basics, but here are some recommendations to help any contributor know the right way to open pull requests: 
- Use protected branches. Doing so will allow you to accept pull requests without fear of breaking production code.
- Use `CODEOWNERS` in combination with protected branches to ensure the right people review changes.
- If you haven't picked a workflow, use a common and well documented one.
- Be explicit about your deployment and release strategy.
