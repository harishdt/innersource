### Answer :crystal_ball:

This repository is the source code for https://services.github.com.

Did you guess it? Probably not, because it doesn't contain many of the necessary elements to make a repository discoverable.

Some suggestions to ensure your teammates can find your repository are:

- Use a descriptive repository name
- Give your repository a description
- Provide a URL for the deployment of the app, or documentation about this project

Discover more about how to make a repository discoverable by visiting the **Files Changed** tab. It's OK if you want to do this later, any resources we cover throughout the course will be available at the end.
